File transfer via socket Java

This lab uses an I/O library.

First, launch Server module.
Server will wait an access from Client side, which you should launch after Server.

Use the right server name and the same port.

Server sends an information by 3 steps:
  -length of the extension of the sending file;
  -extension of the sending file;
  -file.
